<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Yung, and I am a junior website developer. With a passion for coding and a strong foundation in web development, I am eager to contribute my skills to create engaging and user-friendly websites.

  I recently completed my formal education in web development, where I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a basic understanding of popular front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and React. Additionally, I am familiar with backend technologies such as PHP and MySQL, which allows me to create dynamic and interactive websites.
  
  During my studies, I worked on various projects that involved building responsive and visually appealing websites. I am comfortable collaborating with designers and clients to translate their visions into functional websites. I have a keen eye for detail and strive to ensure that every website I create is optimized for performance, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO).
  
  As a junior developer, I am excited to join a team where I can continue to learn and grow. I am open to feedback and always eager to expand my knowledge by keeping up with the latest industry trends and best practices. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and possess strong problem-solving skills.
  
  I believe that effective communication and teamwork are key to delivering successful projects. I am confident that my technical skills, coupled with my enthusiasm for web development, will enable me to contribute positively to any project I am a part of.
